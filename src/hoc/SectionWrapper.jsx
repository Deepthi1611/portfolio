// this is a higher order component which contains another component inside of it
// In React, Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component as an argument 
// and return a new component. HOCs are used to add or modify the behavior of components without directly changing their code. 
// They are a pattern based on Reactâ€™s compositional nature
